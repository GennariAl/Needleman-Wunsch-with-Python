# Needleman-Wunsch-with-Python
I developed a script implementing the Needleman_Wunsch algorithm. The file format is .ipynb: for the algorithm there is a code cell with functions definition and a test cell to see the function working. Running the algorithm require the definition of the class typeException, written in the first cell. This class is used to implement unit tests.
